# Conway's Game of Life! (in Rust)

It's basically exactly what it sounds like.

Partially based on my C++ version [here](https://github.com/JRegimbal/game-of-life). This version has fewer features as of now and mainly exists as practice with Rust.

More information on Conway's Game of Life is available on [Wikipedia](https://en.wikipedia.org/wiki/Conway's_Game_of_Life).
